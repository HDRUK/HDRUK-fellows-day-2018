# Discussion Minutes

These are the minutes taken during the UKRI UK Fellow's Day discussion on Machine Learning and AI.

* What is AI?
	* Hierarchical clustering
	* Bayesian methods
	* DNNs
	* Image analysis
	* Feature extraction
	* Random forests
	* Modelling clinical pathways in primary care
	* "AI is anything that the machine does to mimic intelligent behaviour"
	* Knowledge representation
* What do we want to do?
	* Prediction / patient diagnosis
	* Clustering
	* Correlation finding
	* Data cleaning
	* Feature extraction
	* Augment interpretation power of clinicians
* How do we clean our data / parameterise it?
* What tools do we use?
	* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org)
	* [Keras](https://keras.io)
	* [Python](https://www.python.org)
	* [R](https://www.r-project.org)
	* [XGBoost](https://xgboost.ai)
	* [MRC eMedLab](https://wiki.emedlab.ac.uk/display/EPW/Welcome+to+MRC+eMedLab)
	* [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/)
	* [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com)
	* [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com)
	* [European Open Science Cloud](https://ec.europa.eu/research/openscience/index.cfm?pg=open-science-cloud)
* Training?
	* Python
	* Chest x-ray image blog
	* Data loading / data cleaning
	* How do we get up to speed?
	* We need mathematics!
* What organisations could be approached?
	* Black swan
	* IBM Watson
	* Microsoft
* How can we combine data?
* Should be a way to share cleaned data
	* Need to adhere to standards, and make new standards where necessary.
	* Think "ISO accreditation" for data
		* This might slow down data release, so must do sensibly
		* Multiple data "status" levels
	* How do we motivate people to make clean data?
* Need a way to get recognition for:
	* Making our code available
	* Cleaning data
	* Cleaning code
* Collaborations are critical:
	* Computer Science
	* Mathematics and Statistics
