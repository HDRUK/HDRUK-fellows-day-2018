## Notes

* (Thanks to Waty for these)
* It is often unnecessary for you to learn all of the details of the tools you need to use.
* Rather, you should find help and collaboration with domain experts in Computer Science or mathematics.
* With their help, you should understand:
  * Intuitively, what the algorithms are doing;
  * What input data is required;
  * What output data is generated; and
  * Under what conditions will the algorithm fail.
